Classwork for ATCS: Robot Kinematics Software. 
Code to simulate a 5 degree of freedom robot arm to do forward and inverse kinematics.

Forward kinematics is written with both a spherical coordinate method and a product-of-exponentials method using transformation matrices.
Inverse kinematics uses an extended Newton-Raphson method using spacial twists to find both the correct position and orientation of end effector.

Code to calculate arm forward and inverse kinematics in arm.py
Code to display simulated arm in plot.py
